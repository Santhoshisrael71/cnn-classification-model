# Developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Classification Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification tasks using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to automatically extract features from input data and classify them into predefined categories with high accuracy.

Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in computer vision applications such as image recognition, object detection, medical imaging, and pattern classification.
